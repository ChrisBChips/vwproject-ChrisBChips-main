Regrade Changes:
Added getters/setters to UML
Made WorldModel variables private
Split getCurrentImage to getCurrentBackgroundImage and getCurrentEntityImage, updated in UML








addEntity could have gone in Entity or WorldModel
1) I selected WorldModel
2) I thought it would be more readable to call it on the world model due to the name "addEntity"

unscheduleAllEvents could go in EventScheduler or Entity
1) I selected EventScheduler
2) It made more sense with the other functions in EventScheduler 

load could go in WorldModel or ImageStore
1) I selected ImageStore
2) I also put processLine in there and since load calls processLine, it would be more efficient to have them together

tryAddEntity could go in WorldModel or Entity
1) I selected Worldmodel
2) I feel like there are enough methods in Entity

moveEntity could go in WorldModel or Entity
1) I selected Worldmodel
2) I feel like there are enough methods in Entity

removeEntity could go in WorldModel or Entity
1) I selected Worldmodel
2) I feel like there are enough methods in Entity

removeEntityAt could go in WorldModel or Entity
1) I selected Worldmodel
2) I feel like there are enough methods in Entity

Parce Functions could go in WorldModel, ImageStore, or stay in Functions
1) I'm keeping them in Functions
2) It calls other independant functions that will be staying in Functions
