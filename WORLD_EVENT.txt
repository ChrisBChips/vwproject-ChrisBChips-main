How to trigger: Click anywhere in bounds.

What should happen: A 5x5 grid centered at the mouse click is affected. 
All background tiles change to a gray floor texture, any Miners (Full or Not Full) 
should have visors places over their faces, and an Among Us crewmate dancing should
appear at the location of the mouse click. The crewmate replaces any entity already there.

What affected Entities do: Only Miners are affected, and the new ones should chase after
OreBlobs instead of Ore. When they get to the OreBlob, they stop. Their goal is to trap
the OreBlobs with their bodies. Modified Miners are called "Buffed" in the code.

What the new entity is/does: The new Entity is an orange crewmate from Among Us
(Called Amogus in the code). It walks around using the same A* pathing targeting OreBlobs.
When it gets to one, it destroys the OreBlob then moves on to the next one. It can pass
through buffed Miners, destroying them (They were imposters). 
It intentionally moves slightly slower than all other Miners

I worked on this solo.
